
1. Upload the notebook "assign3_Q3_Q4_Densenet_n_Understanding_CNN.ipynb" into Colab
2. Run the first cell ( the one with "!pip install torch torchvision ...... ")
3. The cell would throw some pip errors & ask you to RESTART IT
4. PLEASE DO RESTART IT - or else the code will fail later
5. The original code had LR =0.01 , this takes too much time.
I found LR =0.05 is optimum. My notebook shows output for both

TO SAVE TIME, Please skip the LR=0.01 cell
It has a HEADER -- 
"# YOU MAY WANT TO SKIP/DELETE THE NEXT CELL
# 100 Epochs with Learning Rate lr =0.01"  ( without Quotes) 

ie RUN ALL CELLS before That cell . Skip the next cell. 

Run all AFTER from "# 50 Epochs with Learning Rate lr =0.05" ( Without Quotes) 


NOTE - IF IT FAILS in first 3/4 cells -- just RERUN everything before "# YOU MAY WANT TO SKIP/DELETE THE NEXT CELL"
After restarting the runtime ( if prompted)
